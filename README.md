# Graphical User Interface Productivity

GUIPro is a set of tools to improve usability, productivity and accessibility of the standard win32 interface while keeping the tools as light as possible. All tools have very small memory footprints.
GUIPro is mostly composed of `HulK`, `PortAL` and `VulCan` tools.

## Portable Application Launcher - _PortAL_

The goal of PortAL is to give fast and easy way to launch applications.

* It can be thanks to icons in the systray or thanks to hotkeys.
* You can launch directly one application or you can open a menu to select what you want to do.

All the interface of PortAL has been made to be flexible, configurable and fast.

More details about the PortAL configuration in the [Wiki](https://github.com/glatigny/guipro/wiki/PortAL-Configuration)

## HotKey UnLimited - _HulK_

When some tools exists to move the windows by pressing a key and clicking with the mouse ; HulK provide a set of features to help the management of the windows.

* Drag your windows simply by clicking in with the "alt" pressed (also called "alt drag").
* The "Alt + F4" shortcut is not very good for the hand while using "Win + Esc" is easier and faster.
* There is no shortcut to minimize a window, so HulK propose to use "Win + ~" one (and "Win + Â²" for Azerty keyboards).
* HulK also allows to resize windows using the right button of the mouse (when the left button allow to move).
* Send windows into the systray (trayinize) ; using a shortcut or by clicking with the right mouse button on the "min" window icon.
* If you do not like the systray to really hide a window, HulK can minimize a window in his systray menu so you can launch a program and completly hidden from you desktop.
* Extend features via plugins, like "desktops" which handle Win10 Virtual Desktops.

## Volume Changer - _VulCan_

It is possible that you do not have a keyboard with multimedia keys, so you can't change easily the volume. You still can access to the "sound parameters" in the systray but you could also want to have a faster way.

* Change the volume (up/down) or mute/unmute it
* Configure the step value for the volume modification
* Use hotkeys or the mouse (button or mouse wheel) with modifiers
* Display the volume status in a tray balloon

In VulCan you can use the mouse wheel in the configuration ; it is quite useful with the right modifier (like Ctrl+Win).
